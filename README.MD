===================

Goals
--------

1. Manage a list.
2. Import and Export calendars to handle the list.
3. Create an optimal order for nodes.
4. Visualise the list as a mindmap/flowchart.

As a plan consists of todos and tasks, I group both of them under the term node.

Therefore, the project consists of three big parts:

* Creating/Editing nodes
* Optimizing the nodes
* Visualizing the whole thing

Project Plan
------------

Done:

* User can register and login
* User can create projects and corresponding nodes 


Todo:

* Bring it online
