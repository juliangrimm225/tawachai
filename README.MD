tawachai
============

tawachai is a project of Julian Grimm. The goal is a web application that combines graph theory with a calendar.

The design is based on the [Flask Mega-Tutorial][1] by Miguel Grinberg.

I did not have any coding experience in the beginning. Therefore:
* The code is very messy and not optimized
* There may be structural things that could be changed
* The updates here on github are extremly messy

I am working actively on fixing my lack of skill and with it the code.
